## 📋 **DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: TestVisualsPage Migration** *(Current Priority)*
**File**: `implementation_task_list.md`
**Goal**: Build TestVisualsPage into the primary app, replacing current main app
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Task Count**: ~60 tasks across 6 phases

#### **Why This Migration?**
- **Superior UI/UX**: TestVisualsPage demonstrates the premium mobile-first design we want
- **Better Architecture**: Independent sections vs. stacked layout
- **User Preference**: TestVisualsPage is closer to original vision despite being a mockup
- **Mobile-First**: Proper iPhone 16 Pro Max constraints and mobile interactions

### **Phase 2: Production Enhancement** *(After Migration)*
**File**: `go_to_market_implementation.md`
**Goal**: Add advanced features and production-grade polish
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Task Count**: ~35-40 major tasks across 6 phases
